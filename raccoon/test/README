Test Ontologies
=======

This directory contains test ontologies. They are in subfolders according to their task. The files are named after their purpose.
Ontologies here are supposed to be as simple as possible, to test specific features or cases.

consistency
=====

The consistency directory contains ontologies for testing the consistency checker.

test_acyclic_inconsistency - ontologies that begin with this name contains inconsistent acyclic ontologies. They are meant to test if the reasoner is able to find inconsistency on acyclic ontologies.
test_acyclic_tbox_abox_inconsistency - contains an inconsistent acyclic ontology, which its inconsistency can only be proven if the reasoner works with both TBox and ABox simultaneously.
test_acyclic_tbox_inconsistency - inconsistent acyclic ontologies having inconsistencies depending only on the TBox.
test_cyclic_consistency - consistent cyclic ontologies, to test if the reasoner knows how to avoid cycling forever.
test_cyclic_inconsistent - inconsistent cyclic ontologies, in which completing the proof depends on following a cycle.
test_cyclic_pure - test a specific case of the PURE
test_skolem_consistency - test if the reasoner is able to prove consistency using skolem constants.
